        "description": "I worked as a full stack developer, actively contributing to both front-end and back-end development. On the back-end, I focused on JavaScript (TypeScript) with the NestJS framework, using tools like Prisma and occasionally TypeORM. On the front-end, I developed features using React, working with both Vite and the Next.js framework. A significant part of my role involved integrating front-end applications with back-end services, giving me solid experience in building seamless, end-to-end web solutions. Toward the end of my time at the company, I also gained experience in infrastructure-related tasks, such as deploying features, analyzing infrastructure, and supporting the release process. I contributed to multiple projects, handled technical documentation, and worked on third-party integrations, including payment systems and AI-powered services."
